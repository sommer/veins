 * Abstraction for (recurring) Timers for cSimpleModule.

 * To use, instantiate one TimerManager per cSimpleModule, then call its handleMessage method from that of the cSimpleModule.
 *
 * In order to schedule a timer, create a TimerSpecification object using the corresponding methods.
 * After configuration, use the create function from the TimerManager to actually schedule the configured timer.
