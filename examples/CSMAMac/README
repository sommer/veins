This example shows how to use MiXiMs CSMA protocol implementation.

The network consists of a number of hosts which represent some kind of switches
and a number of hosts which represent clients. At first they build up their
routing tables by sending, forwarding (only switches), receiving and
evaluating "Hello World" messages. After that phase the clients start randomly
"jabbering" with other hosts and the switches only forward the "Jabber"
messages to their destination.

The phy layer uses only "SimplePathlossModel" as AnalogueModel and 
"SNRThresholdDecider" as Decider.

The omnetpp.ini contains the following configurations:

"General" 			- three clients in range of each other, no switch, no 
					propagation	delay
"WithoutPropDelay" 	- four clients and two switches whereas the switches are
					in range of each other and the clients are in range of at
					least one switch, no propagation delay
"WithPropDelay"		- same but with propagation delay
"CollissionMac"		- same configuration but the parameters for the CSMAMacLayer
					lead to more collisions
"Perftest"			- used with CmdEnv for performance testing (time limited)
