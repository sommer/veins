This example shows how to use AnalogueModels.

It contains the following modules/classes:

RandomFreqTimeModel:
An AnalogueModel implementation which defines random attunation values
in time and frequency using the MultiDimMapping.

RandomFrequencyOnlyModel:
An AnalogueModel implementation which defines random attenuation values
in the frequency domain by using the MultiDimMapping class.
Since every mapping represented by the Mapping interface of MiXiM has to be
defined over time this shows how to "simulate" mappings which arent't 
defined over time.

ThresholdDecider:
A quick and dirty implementation of a very verbose Decider. It is only
used for a better illustration of how the AnalogueModels affect the signal
during runtime and shouldn't be used as a template for an actual Decider.

SamplePhyLayer:
A PhyLayer subclass which knows how to initialize our own AnalogueModels
and Decider.

SimpleMacLayer:
A very basic implementation of a Mac layer without using the actual
BaseMacLayer. This is only to keep the example independent from the 
BaseMacLayer, normally you whould just use the BaseMacLayer.


The network itself consists of only two host which keep ping-pong-ing
messages between each other.

The simulation has the following run configurations:

"General" 		- infinite ping-pong-ing without simulation of propagation delay
"WithPropDelay"	- same with simulation of propagation delay
"PerfTest"		- meant to be used when called with CmdEnv for some performance
			 	testing (time limited)
