Mixnet Framework
================

Mixnet is a project contained in MiXiM's "inet" folder which provides all
modules, examples and documentation concerning using MiXiM and INET together
in the same network.

Mixnet connects INET's application layer, IP-stack and non-wireless NICs with
MiXiM's NICs and mobility modules. Thus, using Mixnet a node in a simulation may
contain modules of INET and MiXiM.


Getting started
---------------

To set up and run Mixnet, you need:
    * MiXiM (since 1.3)
    * the "inet4mixnet" fork from github: http://github.com/mixim/inet4mixnet
    
How to prepare MiXiM, INET and Mixnet:
1.  Install MiXiM and add its project to your OMNeT IDE
    (see MiXiM's INSTALL-file in the MiXiM folder)
2.  Download "inet4mixnet" from http://github.com/mixim/inet4mixnet/tarball/v1.0
3.  Import the downloaded "inet4mixim" project into your OMNeT IDE
4.  Now add the mixnet project to your OMNeT IDE
    1.  Choose "File->Import..." from the menu
    2.  Choose "Existing projects into workspace"
    3.  Select "Select root directory" and click "Browse"
    4.  Browse to MiXiM's "inet" directory and click "Ok"
    5.  Under "Projects" you should see and choose "Mixnet"
    6.  Enable "Copy projects into workspace"
    7.  Click "Finish"
5.  Now your OMNeT IDE should contain all three projects: "MiXiM", "INET" and
    "Mixnet"
6.  Choose "Project->Build All" from the menue to build all three projects.
7.  If the build process was successful you can try starting one of the the
    example networks from Mixnet's "examples" directory.

As a next step you can use the examples as templates for your own simulation
networks or have a look at the documentation (see next section).
