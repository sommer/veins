This file contains the general installation hints 
to compile and start using MiXiM.


Requirements
============
- OMNeT++, at least version 4.1b3, 
  downloadable at www.omnetpp.org
  OMNeT++ must be compiled with 
  	- dynamic NED loading (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes setting)
  	- and XML support enabled 
- make (for Linux)
- C++ compiler (for Linux)
- at least Mac OS X 10.5 (for Mac users)


Installation 
============

From the Omnet++ IDE
--------------------
This should be the same for every operating system.

1. Choose "File->Import" from the menu.

2. Choose "General->Existing Projects into Workspace" from the upcoming dialog and proceed with "Next".

3. Choose "Select archive file" and select the MiXiM archive file.

4. "MiXiM" should appear in the "Projects" list below. Import it by clicking on "Finish".

5. Build MiXiM (Ctrl+B)

6. Run an example:
	1. Choose an example from the examples directory.
	2. Right click its executeable and choose "Run as" -> "Run configurations...".
	3. Double click on "Omnet++ Simulation" in the left list to create a new
	   Omnet++ run configuration for this example (each example needs its own Run 
	   configuration). The "Working directory" should be the examples directory.
	   Also make sure the correct executable is choosen under "Executable: ... Other:" 
	   (should be the one inside the examples directory).
	4. Click "Run"
	
7. Try to run one of the examples from the examples folder.

8. To see how to get started with MiXiM please read the section "How to start"
   in the README-file.

From the commandline under Linux
--------------------------------
Unpack the archive (you have probably already done so)
 tar xzf mixim<VERSION>.tgz

1. run the following command in the MiXiM root dir
    make -f makemakefiles CONFIGNAME=gcc-debug
   (you can alternatively also use the gcc-release configuration)

2. type "make all" to make the mixim library and binary 
   and to build the test networks
   
3. Try to run one of the examples from the examples folder.

4. To see how to get started with MiXiM please read the section "How to start"
   in the README-file.
