Purpose
=======
The mobility framework provides abstractions needed to develop network
protocols for non-stationary wireless nodes. 


Requirements
============
The current version of the Mobillity Framework requires OMNeT++ v3.2
or higher.
The only platform it has been tested on is Linux (2.4.xx kernel, 
g++ 3.3.x & 2.6.xx kernel, g++ 4.0.x). Compilation has also been tested
on windows XP, VC++ 8.0.

Installation under Linux
========================
1. Unpack the archive (you have probably already done so)
   tar xzf mobility-fw<VERSION>.tgz

2. Update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to include the 
   "mobility-fw<VERSION>/core/lib" and 
   "mobility-fw<VERSION>/contrib/lib" directories

3. run the mkmk shell script
   ./mkmk

4. make the core and contrib library and all test networks 
   make core && make contrib && make networks


Installation under Windows
==========================
1. Unpack the archive

2. modify the variable OMNETPP_ROOT in mkmk.cmd to point to your 
   OMNeT++ installation directory.

3. run the mkmk.cmd script
   mkmk.cmd

4. make the core and contrib library and all test networks
   nmake /f Makefile.vc core_dir && nmake /f Makefile.vc contrib_dir && 
   nmake /f Makefile.vc networks_dir


Installation under MAC OS
=========================
There are two possibilities to install the MF under MAC OS, 
one is with shared libraries, one without. We did not test
compiling under MAC OS - any feedback welcome!

1. Unpack the archive (you have probably already done so)
   tar xzf mobility-fw<VERSION>.tgz

2. Modify the mkmk.mac script and choose shared libraries or not
   (just comment out the corresponding lines in the script)

3. If you go for shared libraries you need to update your 
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (NOT LD_LIBRARY!) variable to include the
   "mobility-fw<VERSION>/core/lib" and
   "mobility-fw<VERSION>/contrib/lib" directories

4. run the mkmk.mac shell script
   ./mkmk.mac

4. make the core and contrib library and all test networks
   make core && make contrib && make networks


Getting started
===============
 
This will "install" the library in the lib directories and the
include files in the include directories of the MF.

It will also build all networks in the networks directory.

To see if it runs, try the networks in the networks directory.

Copy the template from the template directory to a directory of
your choice -- it has its own INSTALL instructions to get you
started quickly with your own simulation. NOTE: The template 
directory is not fully adapted to MF 2.0. So not all the stuff
will work!


Release notes
=============
* 2.0p3
just another preview. Basically just contains several 802.11 bug fixes.
Re-added old manual of MF v1
* 2.0p2:
Preview no.2. Main enhancements (apart from some minor bug fixes) are:
- windows make system should work know. See the install directions for 
  details
- MAC OS make system added. MF can be installed on MAC OS either with or 
  without shared libraries. NOT TESTED!
- 802.11 should work again - at least with the basic bitrate. However,
  the automatic bitrate adaption still crashes.
- We started to adapt the template folder to MF 2.0 - not finished yet!
* 2.0p1:
Preview of a MF with major restructuring and redesign. As with previews there
may still be bugs and not everything has been thorouly tested yet. Especially 
the 802.11 network still CRASHES! The manual has not been updated yet, please 
use the doxygen documentation for detailed information.
Key changes include:
- enhanced efficiency of the code (speed and memory consumption), up to 
  thousands of nodes can now be simulated on standard PCs
  - added sendDirect option (less gates -> less memory)
  - added grid to channel control to speed up connection management
- more user implementation flexibility
  - reduced core MF (only contains basic mobility, channel control and modules
    up to the MAC)
  - cleaner possibility to add / modify control infos to messages
  - moved radio related stuff into a seperate radio module
  - added arp functionality
- completely redesigned blackboard
  - only publisher can change published items
  - items are identified by their class instead of strings (speed!)
  - items can be subclassed and extended
- better mobility support
  - complete border handling implemented
  - supported policies are: reflect, wrap, place randomly and raise error
- bug fixes
  - several bugs removed from aloha, csma and snr-eval modules
  - started to debug 802.11 - NOT FINISHED yet!
