This mobility extension for OMNeT++ has been written by several people
at the Telecommunication Networks Group at the Technische Universitaet
Berlin. 

The general idea and overall structure is mainly due to Holger
Karl. The first version was written within a project in June 2001 by
Heiko Scheunemann and Daniel M. Kirsch. However, none of their code
survived the complete review by Steffen Sroka, who wrote the framework
for better integration with OMNeT++ and higher speed. He had help
from Christian Frank, who reviewed the mobility and position handling
and Witold Drytkiewicz who speeded up the connection handling of the
ChannelControl module. Marc Loebbers added the dynamic gate handling and 
continued documenting the code. He had a lot of help by Daniel Willkomm. 
Both restructured the code and documented it.

Currently, Andreas Koepke and Daniel Willkomm are maintaining the code. 
Andreas greatly improved the efficiency and speed of the MF, so that up 
to thousands of nodes can be simulated now at reasonable speed and memory
consumption. Daniel extended the border handling in the mobility module
originally introduced by Andras Varga.
